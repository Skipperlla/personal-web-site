        Two years ago, I was introduced to programming for the first time and
        started developing software professionally for about a year. I clearly
        remember writing my first lines of code, getting stuck, finding the
        problem and fixing it. At this point, I realized that there was a
        rewarding feeling I experienced when the app ran. I quickly learned what
        I wanted to be in life. Since then my passion has never changed, I`ve
        gained more skills along the way. <br />
        <br /> When I`m not working, I learn Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe
        Photoshop to improve myself and learn new skills.
