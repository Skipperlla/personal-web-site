        Hi my name is Ã–mer Esmer.I was born in Turkey/Istanbul. 2 year ago I
        started programming with Node.js for write web apps. I mostly use
        Javascript and Typescript these are my favourites. after I learn
        Typescript I started learn React. For starting I was hate Next.js
        because at that time it was boring. at now I love React and Next.js,
        thanks for reading good bye.
